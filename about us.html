    <h2>Our History</h2>
    <p>Our company has only been in operation since January of 2018; but don’t let that short timeline fool you, we can pull more than our weight and we are committed to helping those who need a conferencing environment to reach their potential outside of their school environment, where they may not be getting the type of learning that is perfect for them. We may be new, but together with our users, we can become the best conferencing service imaginable</p>
    <h2>Our Product History</h2>
    <p>We’ve changed a lot in our short time as a company and we will continue to evolve with our user’s needs. Let’s take a look back to some highlights of our development.</p>

    <h2>Going Forward</h2>
    <p> Like what we have to offer but think that you have some ideas that can be brought to the table? Think you have the next big revolutionary idea swimming in your head, just begging to be realized and you know others would agree? This section allows for our users to pitch their ideas and have others vote on what works and what doesn’t so that we can keep our site working in ways that the user finds most effective, which, in turn, makes our users work more effectively in their courses.</p>
