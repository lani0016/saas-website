    <h2>Our History</h2>
    <p>Our company has only been in operation since January of 2018; but don’t let that short timeline fool you, we can pull more than our weight and we are committed to helping those who need a conferencing environment to reach their potential outside of their school environment, where they may not be getting the type of learning that is perfect for them. We may be new, but together with our users, we can become the best conferencing service imaginable</p>
    <h2>Our Product History</h2>
    <p>We’ve changed a lot in our short time as a company and we will continue to evolve with our user’s needs. Let’s take a look back to some highlights of our development.</p>

          <td>• Our website is up and running, our only feature is our Note swapping section, we are a single paged website • Our website has improved, we now have an about us page (we are here now), all of our sections have their first versions working but we have no way to crowd fund • Our website has its first packages, we are now a multi-page website, we are less boxy looks wise and we have enabled crowd funding.</td>
          <td>• We have arrived to our current look, we now have a section to allow suggestions from our users, and an area that allows us to notify our users when new updates will become available, we also have membership cards so that our users can try out the new features that premium members get to experience but only for a limited time as a trial before they switch to the next package up.</td>

    <h2>Going Forward</h2>
    <p> Like what we have to offer but think that you have some ideas that can be brought to the table? Think you have the next big revolutionary idea swimming in your head, just begging to be realized and you know others would agree? This section allows for our users to pitch their ideas and have others vote on what works and what doesn’t so that we can keep our site working in ways that the user finds most effective, which, in turn, makes our users work more effectively in their courses.</p>
